# FlatIcon Client

Simple FlatIcon Client for that I use for my own projects.

```bash
pip install flaticon
```

## ü§î How It's Work?

- Search `query` on flaticon (for more specific settings, change shape or order_by in `main.py`)
- Creates `flaticon` folder to `HOME` directory and store every query it's own folder
- Download all image results if it's not exists

## ‚≠êÔ∏è Example

```python
from flaticon import FlatIconClient

with FlatIconClient() as client:
    images = client.search_for_images("cat", count=2)
    for image in images:
        client.download_image(image)
```
